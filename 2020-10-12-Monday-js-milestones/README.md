# Session Notes: JS Milestones

## Monday, October 12, 2020

See <https://github.com/jfarmer/milestones-js> for the milestones.

In these notes, copy and run `numbers.js` on the terminal:

```console
node numbers.js
```

Read two things:

1. The output of `node numbers.js`
1. The code inside [numbers.js](numbers.js) itself
