# Observations

Move left, right jump, play with controls
Struggling to start the game
Timing was easier for some than others (pressing buttons at right time)
No explanation of game things, you don't know what's going to happen, game "explains" nothing
The second player had a better success rate because they saw what to do
- Coordination
