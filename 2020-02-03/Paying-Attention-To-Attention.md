# Paying Attention to Attention

----------

> But the moment one thinks of the matter, one sees how false a notion of experience that is which would make it tantamount to the mere presence to the senses of an outward order. Millions of items of the outward order are present to my senses which never properly enter into my experience. Why? Because they have no *interest* for me.
>
> My experience is what I agree to attend to. Only those items which I *notice* shape my mind — without selective interest, experience is an utter chaos.
>
> — William James, *The Principles of Psychology*, *Chapter XI - Attention* (1890)
