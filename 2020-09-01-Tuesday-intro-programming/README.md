# Session Notes: intro-programming

## Tuesday, September 1, 2020

Look at `scratch.js`. You can copy the file yourself.

On your computer, save `scratch.js` into a folder (directory) of your choice. Let's say it's in a folder called `javascript` on your Desktop.

Navigate to that folder and run `scratch.js` with:

```console
node scratch.js
```

Node is a JavaScript interpreter. Like a player piano, you point it at a JavaScript program and it "plays the program" described inside.

## Core Concepts

See <https://github.com/jfarmer/intro-javascript> for a quick crash course in programming and JavaScript.

Every programming language has a small number of building blocks that can be combined to form any program you can imagine. Everything concept, feature, technology, or best practice beyond these basic building blocks were invented to help us mere humans manage the complexity of larger and larger programs.

These building blocks are:

1. Data Types — How do we get computers to treat numbers and text differently?
1. Variables — How do we give data a label and then refer to the data by that label?
1. Conditionals / Branching — How do get a computer to make a choice? If X take that left fork. If Y take the right fork.
1. Collections — How do we get a computer to deal with a collection of information as a single unit, e.g., dealing with a list of numbers
1. Iteration / Looping — How do we get a computer to perform an operation repeatedly or carry out some operation until a condition is met?
1. Functions — In the same way that variables let us refer to values by name, functions let us refer to code by name.
