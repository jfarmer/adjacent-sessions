# Projects (Thursday, Feb 27)

## What Can We Do

- Create a static HTML page
- Read a file
- Write a file
- An interactive HTML document (by using JavaScript)
- HTML generated by a program
  - Statically, like the photo gallery app
  - Dynamically, like the express sandbox
- We can make servers (i.e., computers can talk to each other)
- Use CSS to change the appearance of an HTML page
- User inputs
  - On the command line (using something like `readLineSync`) (keyboard)
  - Via clicks on an HTML document
  - Via data sent over a network
- Multiple pages on a website (both statically generated and dynamically generated)

## Ideas

- Network game (checkers, chess, toc tac toe)
- Checkers in the browser
- Atari system
- Pong! (where it goes is TBD)
- Uno game!
- Timezone page!
- Mad libs!
- Playlist web application (in browser)
- Find Me Food Fast
- Website for the class / cohort / information / profiles
- Connect Four over the network
- Spotify (get those files!)
- Type on page and they fade away, disappearing journal
